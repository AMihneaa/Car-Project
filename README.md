# Spring Boot and ReactJS

This is an application designed to test certain functionalities on both the client and server sides.

The server side is built using the latest version of Spring Boot, while the client side is developed with the ReactJS framework. Currently, the client side is designed for local usage. 

There isn't a dedicated server yet to maintain the configuration of routes for online usage. In the future, I will create a small server using Express.js for that purpose. The primary server built in Spring Boot is responsible for handling the entire application logic, security aspects, and database connections. The Express.js server I plan to create will be used solely to provide specific application routes that render components.
